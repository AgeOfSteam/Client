#Legacy of the Survivors

Modpack for the game Minecraft (1.7.10) using forge (10.13.4.1448+)

#Story

As twilight falls, a boiler explodes in the distance, showing shards of glistening metal into the heavens like water from a grand fountain. Steel against steel and the sounds of gunfire creep closer as purple flames consume the edges of the great city of Karne.  The malice of the Crimson Order has doomed the world, the great sacrafice awakened the Eldar one; who now blankets the world with taint. The age of Progress has now come to an end.

Instead of joining your fellow countryman in the last, futile, defense of the city, you stand watching helplessly from the Primary Magisters Tower as the taint consumes everything you hold dear.  Since the awakening magic only responds to those who can touch the most ancient of magics, and the magic they command pales in comparision to what could have been controlled years earlier.

All plans to defeat the Eldar one have failed, however with some ancient magic it may be possible to outlast, for the ancient one will one day return to slumber.  The Eldar one is drawn to those who can control the ancient magics, so only individuals disconnected from all magic may be saved.  You are one of those people seent over 5,000 years to the future to rebuild, colonize the world.  

While magic can be re-established this modpack focuses mostly on technologoy, particularly steam based power systems.

#TODO
Add Enviromine for Physics (Intensive Setup), Heat, Sanity, and Water. (No earthquake, too buggy and destructive)
Add Finite Water Mod.  (Currently contains an ASM compatibility issue with COFH)
Add Reika's Mods (Reactor, Rotary, Electric, Etc.)
Add MineColony. (Not Public ATM)
Add Server Pack. (When Client is optimized, not a moment sooner!)
